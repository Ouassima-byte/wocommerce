== Flexible Invoices in a nutshell ==

Flexible PDF Invoices for WooCommerce & WordPress is a plugin for invoicing in WooCommerce. You can use it to invoice orders in your WooCommerce store. Also, it perfectly runs in a standalone WordPress, so you can invoice your services directly in the WordPress dashboard.

PRO version is a fantastic plugin that automates invoicing. And it will do it for the MOSS procedure if you want as well! Individual customers will receive documents with the proper EU VAT number and VAT on the invoice. The business buyers will get reverse charge PDF invoices for WooCommerce orders thanks to the automatic EU VAT number validation in the checkout. The plugin is also great if you need three different types of documents - invoice, proforma, and correction invoice.

The PRO version supports WooCommerce integration with many features like full EU VAT support for the vat invoice. The plugin generates WooCommerce invoices automatically with full support for EU transactions. Also, thanks to the plugin, you may issue invoices in WordPress. The WooCommerce billing and invoicing have never been easier. Try how easy it is to configure the plugin and download invoices :)

== Installation ==

You can install the plugin like any other WordPress plugin.
1. Download and unzip the latest release of the plugin.
2. Upload the entire plugin directory to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in the WordPress Administration.

You can also use WordPress uploader to upload the plugin zip file in WordPress menu Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin. Then go directly to point 3.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

PDF invoices will be issued with WooCommerce order's positions according to the tax settings in your store. You may also edit or/ and add an invoice manually in WordPress to check the proper EU VAT number and annotation on the invoice according to the type of the customer.

The plugin in the PRO version allows you also to create both reverse charge invoices and invoices with correct VAT according to the customer type (individual or company) 100% automatically. This is possible thanks to the built-in EU VAT number validation for the invoice (you may call this feature an eu vat invoice checker if you will).

Yes. You may [set currencies in the plugin's settings for WordPress](https://docs.flexibleinvoices.com/article/787-currencies-for-invoicing-in-wordpress). When WooCommerce is active the order will use its currency settings. And the plugin will issue a currency invoice.
